# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely need to edit after that.
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.
# Use 'bundle exec jekyll serve -- --watch' to keep up and running watching changes
# that may happen in the folder src while you are developing.
